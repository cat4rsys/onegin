My uncle, a most worthy gentleman,
When he fell seriously ill,
By snuffing it made us all respect him,
Couldn't have done better if he tried.
His behaviour was a lesson to us all.
But, God above, what crushing boredom
To sit with the malingerer night and day
Not moving even one footstep away.
What demeaning hypocrisy
To amuse the half-dead codger,
To fluff up his pillows, and then,
Mournfully to bring him his medicine;
To think to oneself, and to sigh:
When the devil will the old rascal die?
The young scapegrace was so deeming,
When he by post-chaise in dust
Was shaking. Due to Zues he’s being
The heir of all relatives in trust.
Ruslan’s, Lyudmila’s friends!
Somehow, Without prefaces, just now,
For hero of my book
Let me attract attentive look:
Onegin, friend of mine for years,
Was born on Neva-river’s banks.
May be, you rose from the clans
In those places, or have dears,
Somewhere you could look at me,
But harmful is the North for me,
His father served for many years,
And fell in debt, such big and vast,
That, giving balls three times a year,
He squandered all he had at last.
But Eugene’s fate for him was fair:
At first by Madame he was cared,
But then a frenchman took her place.
The boy was frisky but with grace.
Monsieur l’Abbe, a Frenchman mere,
To give the boy some chance to rest,
Was teaching him with ready jest,
With morals never was severe,
For pranks reproved with gentle talks,
To Summer Garden took for walks.
Insurgent youth is not yet endless.
When Eugene was to change his sort
In times of hopes, tender sadness,
Monsieur was driven from the court.
Onegin’s now free from care.
In fashion has he cut his hair,
Like London dandy, well arrayed,
First coming to the world he made.
His French was so perfect now,
That he could chat, as well as write,
He was in dances quick and light,
Without tension he could bow:
What more you want? The world said: why,
He is a clever, pretty guy.
We all to learn had little go
And anyhow something got,
With education, as you know,
We all can shine, and bless it God!
Onegin was in eyes of people,
(Which were in judgements strict, not feeble,)
A pedant but of science man.
He had a happy talent then:
He was enabled, slightly rushing,
To speak of anything at once,
As real expert does by chance.
He could be silent in discussion,
His epigram’s unwaited file
Could make all pretty ladies smile.
But Latin’s not in fashion now.
To tell the truth but frank enough,
He knew the Latin anyhow:
To talk about epigraf,
Of Jouvenale to talk much better,
To end with vale own letter,
Remembered, though with mistakes,
Two little verses of Enaid’s.
He never wished to rummage quickly
In chronological thick dust
Of writings of the life in past,
But ancient anecdotes deeply -
From Romul to the present day -
In depth of mind he kept away.
Not having any higher passion
To rhymes to dedicate his life,
Iambus he, at frank confession,
From trochee couldn’t tell meanwhile.
Feocrite, Gomer were reproved,
Yet Adam Smith was well approved,
In house-keeping he was best
Arid any problems put to test:
Of how state itself enriches,
And how lives, which way and why
Without gold can revive
While simple product is its richness:
His father didn’t understand
Arid put in pledge the whole land,
To tell you all, what he had known,
I haven’t any time at all.
His genius was unique, alone,
He knew of something best of all,
Which was for him from time of childhood
Like work and torment, was delightful,
Which pressed his spirits all the way
And kept his laziness for day, -
It was the art of tender passion,
By Nazon brightly glorified.
But Nazon was by world denied
And suffered past rebellious session:
Moldavia, that’s far away
From Italy, was end of way.
From early times he was dissembling,
Some hidden hope he could leave,
He pined away, he was dissuading,
Was dull and jealous, made believe;
Could come such proud or obedient,
Could be attentive or indifferent;
Was languishing and taciturn,
Eloquent ardently in turn;
In hearty letter, as its sender,
He was slipshod. For all of that
Of own life he could forget!
His look was always quick and tender,
Was impudent and shy; sometimes
Could show how tear shines,
Was seeming new on each occasion,
With jokes innocence amazed.
Could give a fright by desperation,
With flattery could draw one’s gaze,
Was able any glimpse of sweetness,
Of vergin years bias giftness
With passion and the wit to gain,
For sudden tenderness to wait,
For words of love to be entreating,
First move of heart to catch by chance,
To chase the love and all at once
To get agreed a secret meeting,
And then from people far away
To give her lessons all the day?
And how could he be annoying
The hearts of ladies, whom he knew!
But when his thoughts were of destroying
His own rivals, though few,
His scandal talks were such backbiting!
His nets for them were so frightening!
But blissful husband of coquette,
To part from him you did regret!
By cunning husband he was greeted,
Of Faublas previous a fan;
By one mistrustful old man;
Him stately cuckold admitted,
Who’s always proud of himself,
Of dinner and of wife herself.
Sometimes, when he’s in bed yet sleeping,
Some papers they are bringing him.
What? Invitations for a meeting?
Three houses will wait for him.
Some balls, one children’s entertainment...
What will he choose for his engagement?
With which to start? In wonder style
To every place he came in time.
Meanwhile he’s dressed for walk at morning,
His bolivar he’s having on
And comes to bouieward quite forlone:
He there at a space is walking
Until his breget sleepless, fine
Will strike the bells for him to dine.
Its dark. In sledge he’s sitting now.
-Away, away! - the driver marks,
And, covered with the frosted gown,
His beaver collar now sparks.
To Talon’s surely he’s raiding.
Kaverin there is awaiting.
He comes: the corks for ceiling pass,
The wine like comet splashes fast.
A bloody roast-beef is given,
And truffles, splendour of teenage,
In France of cooking highest gauge;
And pie train Strassburg, freshly driven,
Between the Limburg lively cheese
And best pine-apple gold squeese.
The thirst demands some more of drinking
To cool hot cutlet’s fat at once,
But breget bells are now clinking:
New ballet will begin by chance,
Of theatre strict legislator,
Inconstant adorer of later
Quite charming actresses, he is
An honoured cityzen of links.
For theatre Onegin’s speeding.
In it each man is free at all:
He may each entrechat catcall,
Or hiss Moina, Fedra greeting;
Or Cleopatra may encore
(By others to be heard once more).
Enchanting land! In days of wisdom,
Of satire great potentate,
Fonvizin shone, a friend of freedom,
Knyazhnin was always up-to-date.
With Ozerov all were delighted,
Semyonova with him divided
The tears of the people’s awe.
Katenin there could restore
Of Corneille stately genius; there
Was known prickly Shakhovskoy
Who wrote comedies with joy;
With glory Didla’s crowned there.
And there, in the shades of links,
My younger days were rushing things,
My goddesses’ what are you? where?
You listen to my grievous call:
Are you the same, or others dared
To change, replace you there all?
Shall I again your chorus hear?
Of Russian Terpsichore’s dear
Shall see emotional flight?
Or dismal eye will never find
At boring stage some known actor,
And, turning to unknown world
My disillusioned lornette,
Of joy some careless spectator,
With yawn I’ll cover disrespect
And shall of bygone recollect?
Each box in theatre is shining,
In pit each stall already boils,
In gallery the claps are flying,
And rising curtain makes a noise.
Half-aireal and resplended,
To magic bow all attended,
Istómina’s in front of pit,
With nymths she waits to make a hit.
With one of feet the floor she’s touching,
With other slowly she wheels,
Then sudden caper - and she fleets
Like down from Eolus marching,
She makes her figure twine and twist,
With quick her foot the foot she beats.

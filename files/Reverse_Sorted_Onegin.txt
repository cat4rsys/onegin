You listen to my grievous call:
Yet Adam Smith was well approved,
With yawn I’ll cover disrespect
With which to start? In wonder style
With quick her foot the foot she beats.
With passion and the wit to gain,
Without tension he could bow:
Without gold can revive
With other slowly she wheels,
With one of feet the floor she’s touching,
With nymths she waits to make a hit.
With morals never was severe,
With jokes innocence amazed.
With glory Didla’s crowned there.
With flattery could draw one’s gaze,
With education, as you know,
With Ozerov all were delighted,
Will strike the bells for him to dine.
Who wrote comedies with joy;
Who’s always proud of himself,
While simple product is its richness:
(Which were in judgements strict, not feeble,)
Which was for him from time of childhood
Which pressed his spirits all the way
When the devil will the old rascal die?
When he fell seriously ill,
When he by post-chaise in dust
When Eugene was to change his sort
What will he choose for his engagement?
What more you want? The world said: why,
What demeaning hypocrisy
What? Invitations for a meeting?
We all to learn had little go
We all can shine, and bless it God!
Was teaching him with ready jest,
Was shaking. Due to Zues he’s being
Was seeming new on each occasion,
Was languishing and taciturn,
Was known prickly Shakhovskoy
Was impudent and shy; sometimes
Was dull and jealous, made believe;
Was born on Neva-river’s banks.
Was able any glimpse of sweetness,
Until his breget sleepless, fine
Two little verses of Enaid’s.
To think to oneself, and to sigh:
To tell you all, what he had known,
To tell the truth but frank enough,
To talk about epigraf,
To speak of anything at once,
To sit with the malingerer night and day
To rhymes to dedicate his life,
To part from him you did regret!
To magic bow all attended,
To give the boy some chance to rest,
To give her lessons all the day?
To get agreed a secret meeting,
To fluff up his pillows, and then,
To every place he came in time.
To end with vale own letter,
To cool hot cutlet’s fat at once,
To chase the love and all at once
To change, replace you there all?
To amuse the half-dead codger,
To Talon’s surely he’s raiding.
To Summer Garden took for walks.
Three houses will wait for him.
The young scapegrace was so deeming,
The wine like comet splashes fast.
The thirst demands some more of drinking
The tears of the people’s awe.
Then sudden caper - and she fleets
The heir of all relatives in trust.
The hearts of ladies, whom he knew!
The boy was frisky but with grace.
That he could chat, as well as write,
That, giving balls three times a year,
Somewhere you could look at me,
Sometimes, when he’s in bed yet sleeping,
Some papers they are bringing him.
Somehow, Without prefaces, just now,
Some hidden hope he could leave,
Some balls, one children’s entertainment...
She makes her figure twine and twist,
Shall see emotional flight?
Shall I again your chorus hear?
Semyonova with him divided
Ruslan’s, Lyudmila’s friends!
Remembered, though with mistakes,
Quite charming actresses, he is
Or hiss Moina, Fedra greeting;
Or dismal eye will never find
Or Cleopatra may encore
Onegin was in eyes of people,
Onegin’s now free from care.
Onegin, friend of mine for years,
Of writings of the life in past,
Of vergin years bias giftness
Of theatre strict legislator,
Of satire great potentate,
Of own life he could forget!
Of joy some careless spectator,
Of how state itself enriches,
Of dinner and of wife herself.
Of Russian Terpsichore’s dear
Of Jouvenale to talk much better,
Of Faublas previous a fan;
Of Corneille stately genius; there
Not moving even one footstep away.
Not having any higher passion
New ballet will begin by chance,
My younger days were rushing things,
My uncle, a most worthy gentleman,
My goddesses’ what are you? where?
My disillusioned lornette,
Mournfully to bring him his medicine;
Monsieur was driven from the court.
Monsieur l’Abbe, a Frenchman mere,
Moldavia, that’s far away
Meanwhile he’s dressed for walk at morning,
May be, you rose from the clans
Like work and torment, was delightful,
Like down from Eolus marching,
Like London dandy, well arrayed,
Let me attract attentive look:
Knyazhnin was always up-to-date.
Kaverin there is awaiting.
Katenin there could restore
It was the art of tender passion,
Its dark. In sledge he’s sitting now.
Istómina’s in front of pit,
In times of hopes, tender sadness,
In those places, or have dears,
Insurgent youth is not yet endless.
In pit each stall already boils,
In it each man is free at all:
In house-keeping he was best
In hearty letter, as its sender,
In gallery the claps are flying,
In fashion has he cut his hair,
In depth of mind he kept away.
Inconstant adorer of later
In chronological thick dust
In France of cooking highest gauge;
I haven’t any time at all.
Iambus he, at frank confession,
His scandal talks were such backbiting!
His own rivals, though few,
His nets for them were so frightening!
His look was always quick and tender,
His genius was unique, alone,
His father served for many years,
His father didn’t understand
His epigram’s unwaited file
His bolivar he’s having on
His behaviour was a lesson to us all.
His beaver collar now sparks.
His French was so perfect now,
Him stately cuckold admitted,
He was slipshod. For all of that
He was in dances quick and light,
He was enabled, slightly rushing,
He there at a space is walking
He squandered all he had at last.
He pined away, he was dissuading,
He never wished to rummage quickly
He may each entrechat catcall,
He knew the Latin anyhow:
He knew of something best of all,
He is a clever, pretty guy.
He had a happy talent then:
He could be silent in discussion,
He comes: the corks for ceiling pass,
Half-aireal and resplended,
From trochee couldn’t tell meanwhile.
From early times he was dissembling,
From Romul to the present day -
From Italy, was end of way.
For words of love to be entreating,
For theatre Onegin’s speeding.
For sudden tenderness to wait,
For pranks reproved with gentle talks,
For hero of my book
Fonvizin shone, a friend of freedom,
First move of heart to catch by chance,
First coming to the world he made.
Feocrite, Gomer were reproved,
Enchanting land! In days of wisdom,
Eloquent ardently in turn;
Each box in theatre is shining,
Could show how tear shines,
Couldn't have done better if he tried.
Could make all pretty ladies smile.
Could give a fright by desperation,
Could come such proud or obedient,
Could be attentive or indifferent;
By snuffing it made us all respect him,
(By others to be heard once more).
By one mistrustful old man;
By cunning husband he was greeted,
By Nazon brightly glorified.
But when his thoughts were of destroying
But then a frenchman took her place.
But harmful is the North for me,
But breget bells are now clinking:
But blissful husband of coquette,
But ancient anecdotes deeply -
But Nazon was by world denied
But Latin’s not in fashion now.
But, God above, what crushing boredom
But Eugene’s fate for him was fair:
Between the Limburg lively cheese
-Away, away! - the driver marks,
At first by Madame he was cared,
At boring stage some known actor,
As real expert does by chance.
Arid put in pledge the whole land,
Arid any problems put to test:
Are you the same, or others dared
A pedant but of science man.
An honoured cityzen of links.
And, turning to unknown world
And truffles, splendour of teenage,
And there, in the shades of links,
And then from people far away
And suffered past rebellious session:
And shall of bygone recollect?
And rising curtain makes a noise.
And pie train Strassburg, freshly driven,
And kept his laziness for day, -
And how lives, which way and why
And how could he be annoying
And fell in debt, such big and vast,
And, covered with the frosted gown,
And comes to bouieward quite forlone:
And best pine-apple gold squeese.
And anyhow something got,
A bloody roast-beef is given,

We all can shine, and bless it God!
His nets for them were so frightening!
His scandal talks were such backbiting!
Ruslan’s, Lyudmila’s friends!
Of own life he could forget!
To part from him you did regret!
The hearts of ladies, whom he knew!
(Which were in judgements strict, not feeble,)
Half-aireal and resplended,
To magic bow all attended,
At first by Madame he was cared,
By cunning husband he was greeted,
With Ozerov all were delighted,
Him stately cuckold admitted,
Feocrite, Gomer were reproved,
Yet Adam Smith was well approved,
Like London dandy, well arrayed,
Arid put in pledge the whole land,
First move of heart to catch by chance,
New ballet will begin by chance,
To speak of anything at once,
To cool hot cutlet’s fat at once,
To rhymes to dedicate his life,
And truffles, splendour of teenage,
Onegin was in eyes of people,
But harmful is the North for me,
Somewhere you could look at me,
His genius was unique, alone,
Monsieur l’Abbe, a Frenchman mere,
With morals never was severe,
Of satire great potentate,
That he could chat, as well as write,
My disillusioned lornette,
But blissful husband of coquette,
Some hidden hope he could leave,
With flattery could draw one’s gaze,
To talk about epigraf,
Who’s always proud of himself,
He pined away, he was dissuading,
Like down from Eolus marching,
With one of feet the floor she’s touching,
He was enabled, slightly rushing,
From early times he was dissembling,
The young scapegrace was so deeming,
Each box in theatre is shining,
Meanwhile he’s dressed for walk at morning,
Sometimes, when he’s in bed yet sleeping,
For words of love to be entreating,
To get agreed a secret meeting,
In gallery the claps are flying,
To tell the truth but frank enough,
He knew of something best of all,
He may each entrechat catcall,
When he fell seriously ill,
Like work and torment, was delightful,
By snuffing it made us all respect him,
Fonvizin shone, a friend of freedom,
Enchanting land! In days of wisdom,
My uncle, a most worthy gentleman,
To fluff up his pillows, and then,
A bloody roast-beef is given,
And pie train Strassburg, freshly driven,
With passion and the wit to gain,
Was seeming new on each occasion,
It was the art of tender passion,
Iambus he, at frank confession,
He could be silent in discussion,
Could give a fright by desperation,
Was languishing and taciturn,
And, covered with the frosted gown,
To tell you all, what he had known,
That, giving balls three times a year,
In hearty letter, as its sender,
His look was always quick and tender,
To amuse the half-dead codger,
Of Jouvenale to talk much better,
To end with vale own letter,
In fashion has he cut his hair,
Of theatre strict legislator,
Of joy some careless spectator,
At boring stage some known actor,
Of how state itself enriches,
Remembered, though with mistakes,
Could show how tear shines,
My younger days were rushing things,
For pranks reproved with gentle talks,
And there, in the shades of links,
-Away, away! - the driver marks,
With other slowly she wheels,
In pit each stall already boils,
In those places, or have dears,
Onegin, friend of mine for years,
His father served for many years,
He comes: the corks for ceiling pass,
In times of hopes, tender sadness,
Was able any glimpse of sweetness,
He was in dances quick and light,
For sudden tenderness to wait,
Istómina’s in front of pit,
Could come such proud or obedient,
And anyhow something got,
Of writings of the life in past,
And fell in debt, such big and vast,
Was teaching him with ready jest,
To give the boy some chance to rest,
She makes her figure twine and twist,
His own rivals, though few,
His French was so perfect now,
Somehow, Without prefaces, just now,
With education, as you know,
What more you want? The world said: why,
And kept his laziness for day, -
From Romul to the present day -
But ancient anecdotes deeply -
(By others to be heard once more).
Some balls, one children’s entertainment...
By Nazon brightly glorified.
Couldn't have done better if he tried.
With jokes innocence amazed.
But then a frenchman took her place.
The boy was frisky but with grace.
As real expert does by chance.
First coming to the world he made.
From trochee couldn’t tell meanwhile.
Could make all pretty ladies smile.
To every place he came in time.
Will strike the bells for him to dine.
Onegin’s now free from care.
With glory Didla’s crowned there.
And best pine-apple gold squeese.
And rising curtain makes a noise.
Knyazhnin was always up-to-date.
The tears of the people’s awe.
Of dinner and of wife herself.
For theatre Onegin’s speeding.
To Talon’s surely he’s raiding.
Kaverin there is awaiting.
His behaviour was a lesson to us all.
I haven’t any time at all.
Some papers they are bringing him.
Three houses will wait for him.
A pedant but of science man.
Two little verses of Enaid’s.
To Summer Garden took for walks.
Was born on Neva-river’s banks.
An honoured cityzen of links.
His beaver collar now sparks.
Insurgent youth is not yet endless.
With quick her foot the foot she beats.
With nymths she waits to make a hit.
Monsieur was driven from the court.
The wine like comet splashes fast.
He squandered all he had at last.
The heir of all relatives in trust.
Its dark. In sledge he’s sitting now.
But Latin’s not in fashion now.
From Italy, was end of way.
Not moving even one footstep away.
In depth of mind he kept away.
He is a clever, pretty guy.
And comes to bouieward quite forlone:
But breget bells are now clinking:
To think to oneself, and to sigh:
Let me attract attentive look:
In it each man is free at all:
You listen to my grievous call:
He had a happy talent then:
And suffered past rebellious session:
But Eugene’s fate for him was fair:
While simple product is its richness:
Arid any problems put to test:
Without tension he could bow:
He knew the Latin anyhow:
In France of cooking highest gauge;
Mournfully to bring him his medicine;
Was dull and jealous, made believe;
Or hiss Moina, Fedra greeting;
Of Faublas previous a fan;
By one mistrustful old man;
Eloquent ardently in turn;
Could be attentive or indifferent;
Who wrote comedies with joy;
When the devil will the old rascal die?
My goddesses’ what are you? where?
What? Invitations for a meeting?
To change, replace you there all?
Shall I again your chorus hear?
And shall of bygone recollect?
Shall see emotional flight?
What will he choose for his engagement?
To give her lessons all the day?
Semyonova with him divided
But Nazon was by world denied
Are you the same, or others dared
And, turning to unknown world
His father didn’t understand
Or dismal eye will never find
Which was for him from time of childhood
To chase the love and all at once
His epigram’s unwaited file
With which to start? In wonder style
Until his breget sleepless, fine
Of Corneille stately genius; there
Or Cleopatra may encore
Katenin there could restore
Between the Limburg lively cheese
Without gold can revive
Was shaking. Due to Zues he’s being
He there at a space is walking
The thirst demands some more of drinking
And how could he be annoying
But when his thoughts were of destroying
For hero of my book
But, God above, what crushing boredom
His bolivar he’s having on
Not having any higher passion
We all to learn had little go
Of Russian Terpsichore’s dear
Inconstant adorer of later
Was impudent and shy; sometimes
Quite charming actresses, he is
May be, you rose from the clans
Of vergin years bias giftness
Then sudden caper - and she fleets
He was slipshod. For all of that
With yawn I’ll cover disrespect
When Eugene was to change his sort
In house-keeping he was best
In chronological thick dust
When he by post-chaise in dust
To sit with the malingerer night and day
Which pressed his spirits all the way
And then from people far away
Moldavia, that’s far away
And how lives, which way and why
He never wished to rummage quickly
Was known prickly Shakhovskoy
What demeaning hypocrisy

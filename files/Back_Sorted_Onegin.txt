Semyonova with him divided
Half-aireal and resplended,
To magic bow all attended,
By Nazon brightly glorified.
But Nazon was by world denied
Couldn't have done better if he tried.
At first by Madame he was cared,
Are you the same, or others dared
By cunning husband he was greeted,
With Ozerov all were delighted,
Him stately cuckold admitted,
Feocrite, Gomer were reproved,
Yet Adam Smith was well approved,
Like London dandy, well arrayed,
With jokes innocence amazed.
And, turning to unknown world
Arid put in pledge the whole land,
His father didn’t understand
Or dismal eye will never find
We all can shine, and bless it God!
Which was for him from time of childhood
But then a frenchman took her place.
The boy was frisky but with grace.
First move of heart to catch by chance,
New ballet will begin by chance,
As real expert does by chance.
To speak of anything at once,
To chase the love and all at once
To cool hot cutlet’s fat at once,
First coming to the world he made.
To rhymes to dedicate his life,
And truffles, splendour of teenage,
In France of cooking highest gauge;
When the devil will the old rascal die?
(Which were in judgements strict, not feeble,)
His epigram’s unwaited file
From trochee couldn’t tell meanwhile.
Could make all pretty ladies smile.
Onegin was in eyes of people,
With which to start? In wonder style
To every place he came in time.
But harmful is the North for me,
Somewhere you could look at me,
Mournfully to bring him his medicine;
Will strike the bells for him to dine.
Until his breget sleepless, fine
His genius was unique, alone,
And comes to bouieward quite forlone:
Onegin’s now free from care.
With glory Didla’s crowned there.
Of Corneille stately genius; there
My goddesses’ what are you? where?
Monsieur l’Abbe, a Frenchman mere,
With morals never was severe,
Or Cleopatra may encore
(By others to be heard once more).
Katenin there could restore
Between the Limburg lively cheese
And best pine-apple gold squeese.
And rising curtain makes a noise.
Knyazhnin was always up-to-date.
Of satire great potentate,
That he could chat, as well as write,
My disillusioned lornette,
But blissful husband of coquette,
Some hidden hope he could leave,
Was dull and jealous, made believe;
Without gold can revive
The tears of the people’s awe.
With flattery could draw one’s gaze,
To talk about epigraf,
Who’s always proud of himself,
Of dinner and of wife herself.
He pined away, he was dissuading,
For theatre Onegin’s speeding.
To Talon’s surely he’s raiding.
Was shaking. Due to Zues he’s being
Like down from Eolus marching,
With one of feet the floor she’s touching,
He was enabled, slightly rushing,
He there at a space is walking
But breget bells are now clinking:
The thirst demands some more of drinking
From early times he was dissembling,
The young scapegrace was so deeming,
His nets for them were so frightening!
Each box in theatre is shining,
Meanwhile he’s dressed for walk at morning,
Sometimes, when he’s in bed yet sleeping,
For words of love to be entreating,
What? Invitations for a meeting?
To get agreed a secret meeting,
Or hiss Moina, Fedra greeting;
Kaverin there is awaiting.
His scandal talks were such backbiting!
In gallery the claps are flying,
And how could he be annoying
But when his thoughts were of destroying
To think to oneself, and to sigh:
To tell the truth but frank enough,
For hero of my book
Let me attract attentive look:
You listen to my grievous call:
He may each entrechat catcall,
To change, replace you there all?
He knew of something best of all,
His behaviour was a lesson to us all.
In it each man is free at all:
I haven’t any time at all.
When he fell seriously ill,
Like work and torment, was delightful,
Some papers they are bringing him.
Three houses will wait for him.
By snuffing it made us all respect him,
Fonvizin shone, a friend of freedom,
But, God above, what crushing boredom
Enchanting land! In days of wisdom,
Of Faublas previous a fan;
By one mistrustful old man;
A pedant but of science man.
My uncle, a most worthy gentleman,
To fluff up his pillows, and then,
He had a happy talent then:
A bloody roast-beef is given,
And pie train Strassburg, freshly driven,
With passion and the wit to gain,
His bolivar he’s having on
Was seeming new on each occasion,
It was the art of tender passion,
Not having any higher passion
Iambus he, at frank confession,
And suffered past rebellious session:
He could be silent in discussion,
Could give a fright by desperation,
Was languishing and taciturn,
Eloquent ardently in turn;
And, covered with the frosted gown,
To tell you all, what he had known,
We all to learn had little go
Of Russian Terpsichore’s dear
Shall I again your chorus hear?
That, giving balls three times a year,
In hearty letter, as its sender,
His look was always quick and tender,
To amuse the half-dead codger,
Inconstant adorer of later
Of Jouvenale to talk much better,
To end with vale own letter,
But Eugene’s fate for him was fair:
In fashion has he cut his hair,
Of theatre strict legislator,
Of joy some careless spectator,
At boring stage some known actor,
Two little verses of Enaid’s.
Ruslan’s, Lyudmila’s friends!
Of how state itself enriches,
Remembered, though with mistakes,
Was impudent and shy; sometimes
Could show how tear shines,
My younger days were rushing things,
Quite charming actresses, he is
For pranks reproved with gentle talks,
To Summer Garden took for walks.
Was born on Neva-river’s banks.
An honoured cityzen of links.
And there, in the shades of links,
-Away, away! - the driver marks,
His beaver collar now sparks.
With other slowly she wheels,
In pit each stall already boils,
May be, you rose from the clans
In those places, or have dears,
Onegin, friend of mine for years,
His father served for many years,
He comes: the corks for ceiling pass,
Insurgent youth is not yet endless.
In times of hopes, tender sadness,
While simple product is its richness:
Was able any glimpse of sweetness,
Of vergin years bias giftness
With quick her foot the foot she beats.
Then sudden caper - and she fleets
He was slipshod. For all of that
And shall of bygone recollect?
With yawn I’ll cover disrespect
Of own life he could forget!
To part from him you did regret!
He was in dances quick and light,
Shall see emotional flight?
For sudden tenderness to wait,
With nymths she waits to make a hit.
Istómina’s in front of pit,
Could come such proud or obedient,
What will he choose for his engagement?
Some balls, one children’s entertainment...
Could be attentive or indifferent;
And anyhow something got,
When Eugene was to change his sort
Monsieur was driven from the court.
The wine like comet splashes fast.
He squandered all he had at last.
Of writings of the life in past,
And fell in debt, such big and vast,
In house-keeping he was best
Was teaching him with ready jest,
To give the boy some chance to rest,
Arid any problems put to test:
She makes her figure twine and twist,
In chronological thick dust
When he by post-chaise in dust
The heir of all relatives in trust.
His own rivals, though few,
The hearts of ladies, whom he knew!
Without tension he could bow:
He knew the Latin anyhow:
Its dark. In sledge he’s sitting now.
With education, as you know,
But Latin’s not in fashion now.
His French was so perfect now,
Somehow, Without prefaces, just now,
To sit with the malingerer night and day
To give her lessons all the day?
And kept his laziness for day, -
From Romul to the present day -
Not moving even one footstep away.
And then from people far away
Moldavia, that’s far away
In depth of mind he kept away.
Which pressed his spirits all the way
From Italy, was end of way.
What more you want? The world said: why,
And how lives, which way and why
He never wished to rummage quickly
But ancient anecdotes deeply -
Who wrote comedies with joy;
Was known prickly Shakhovskoy
What demeaning hypocrisy
He is a clever, pretty guy.

A bloody roast-beef is given,
And anyhow something got,
And best pine-apple gold squeese.
And comes to bouieward quite forlone:
And, covered with the frosted gown,
And fell in debt, such big and vast,
And how could he be annoying
And how lives, which way and why
And kept his laziness for day, -
And pie train Strassburg, freshly driven,
And rising curtain makes a noise.
And shall of bygone recollect?
And suffered past rebellious session:
And then from people far away
And there, in the shades of links,
And truffles, splendour of teenage,
And, turning to unknown world
An honoured cityzen of links.
A pedant but of science man.
Are you the same, or others dared
Arid any problems put to test:
Arid put in pledge the whole land,
As real expert does by chance.
At boring stage some known actor,
At first by Madame he was cared,
-Away, away! - the driver marks,
Between the Limburg lively cheese
But Eugene’s fate for him was fair:
But, God above, what crushing boredom
But Latin’s not in fashion now.
But Nazon was by world denied
But ancient anecdotes deeply -
But blissful husband of coquette,
But breget bells are now clinking:
But harmful is the North for me,
But then a frenchman took her place.
But when his thoughts were of destroying
By Nazon brightly glorified.
By cunning husband he was greeted,
By one mistrustful old man;
(By others to be heard once more).
By snuffing it made us all respect him,
Could be attentive or indifferent;
Could come such proud or obedient,
Could give a fright by desperation,
Could make all pretty ladies smile.
Couldn't have done better if he tried.
Could show how tear shines,
Each box in theatre is shining,
Eloquent ardently in turn;
Enchanting land! In days of wisdom,
Feocrite, Gomer were reproved,
First coming to the world he made.
First move of heart to catch by chance,
Fonvizin shone, a friend of freedom,
For hero of my book
For pranks reproved with gentle talks,
For sudden tenderness to wait,
For theatre Onegin’s speeding.
For words of love to be entreating,
From Italy, was end of way.
From Romul to the present day -
From early times he was dissembling,
From trochee couldn’t tell meanwhile.
Half-aireal and resplended,
He comes: the corks for ceiling pass,
He could be silent in discussion,
He had a happy talent then:
He is a clever, pretty guy.
He knew of something best of all,
He knew the Latin anyhow:
He may each entrechat catcall,
He never wished to rummage quickly
He pined away, he was dissuading,
He squandered all he had at last.
He there at a space is walking
He was enabled, slightly rushing,
He was in dances quick and light,
He was slipshod. For all of that
Him stately cuckold admitted,
His French was so perfect now,
His beaver collar now sparks.
His behaviour was a lesson to us all.
His bolivar he’s having on
His epigram’s unwaited file
His father didn’t understand
His father served for many years,
His genius was unique, alone,
His look was always quick and tender,
His nets for them were so frightening!
His own rivals, though few,
His scandal talks were such backbiting!
Iambus he, at frank confession,
I haven’t any time at all.
In France of cooking highest gauge;
In chronological thick dust
Inconstant adorer of later
In depth of mind he kept away.
In fashion has he cut his hair,
In gallery the claps are flying,
In hearty letter, as its sender,
In house-keeping he was best
In it each man is free at all:
In pit each stall already boils,
Insurgent youth is not yet endless.
In those places, or have dears,
In times of hopes, tender sadness,
Istómina’s in front of pit,
Its dark. In sledge he’s sitting now.
It was the art of tender passion,
Katenin there could restore
Kaverin there is awaiting.
Knyazhnin was always up-to-date.
Let me attract attentive look:
Like London dandy, well arrayed,
Like down from Eolus marching,
Like work and torment, was delightful,
May be, you rose from the clans
Meanwhile he’s dressed for walk at morning,
Moldavia, that’s far away
Monsieur l’Abbe, a Frenchman mere,
Monsieur was driven from the court.
Mournfully to bring him his medicine;
My disillusioned lornette,
My goddesses’ what are you? where?
My uncle, a most worthy gentleman,
My younger days were rushing things,
New ballet will begin by chance,
Not having any higher passion
Not moving even one footstep away.
Of Corneille stately genius; there
Of Faublas previous a fan;
Of Jouvenale to talk much better,
Of Russian Terpsichore’s dear
Of dinner and of wife herself.
Of how state itself enriches,
Of joy some careless spectator,
Of own life he could forget!
Of satire great potentate,
Of theatre strict legislator,
Of vergin years bias giftness
Of writings of the life in past,
Onegin, friend of mine for years,
Onegin’s now free from care.
Onegin was in eyes of people,
Or Cleopatra may encore
Or dismal eye will never find
Or hiss Moina, Fedra greeting;
Quite charming actresses, he is
Remembered, though with mistakes,
Ruslan’s, Lyudmila’s friends!
Semyonova with him divided
Shall I again your chorus hear?
Shall see emotional flight?
She makes her figure twine and twist,
Some balls, one children’s entertainment...
Some hidden hope he could leave,
Somehow, Without prefaces, just now,
Some papers they are bringing him.
Sometimes, when he’s in bed yet sleeping,
Somewhere you could look at me,
That, giving balls three times a year,
That he could chat, as well as write,
The boy was frisky but with grace.
The hearts of ladies, whom he knew!
The heir of all relatives in trust.
Then sudden caper - and she fleets
The tears of the people’s awe.
The thirst demands some more of drinking
The wine like comet splashes fast.
The young scapegrace was so deeming,
Three houses will wait for him.
To Summer Garden took for walks.
To Talon’s surely he’s raiding.
To amuse the half-dead codger,
To change, replace you there all?
To chase the love and all at once
To cool hot cutlet’s fat at once,
To end with vale own letter,
To every place he came in time.
To fluff up his pillows, and then,
To get agreed a secret meeting,
To give her lessons all the day?
To give the boy some chance to rest,
To magic bow all attended,
To part from him you did regret!
To rhymes to dedicate his life,
To sit with the malingerer night and day
To speak of anything at once,
To talk about epigraf,
To tell the truth but frank enough,
To tell you all, what he had known,
To think to oneself, and to sigh:
Two little verses of Enaid’s.
Until his breget sleepless, fine
Was able any glimpse of sweetness,
Was born on Neva-river’s banks.
Was dull and jealous, made believe;
Was impudent and shy; sometimes
Was known prickly Shakhovskoy
Was languishing and taciturn,
Was seeming new on each occasion,
Was shaking. Due to Zues he’s being
Was teaching him with ready jest,
We all can shine, and bless it God!
We all to learn had little go
What? Invitations for a meeting?
What demeaning hypocrisy
What more you want? The world said: why,
What will he choose for his engagement?
When Eugene was to change his sort
When he by post-chaise in dust
When he fell seriously ill,
When the devil will the old rascal die?
Which pressed his spirits all the way
Which was for him from time of childhood
(Which were in judgements strict, not feeble,)
While simple product is its richness:
Who’s always proud of himself,
Who wrote comedies with joy;
Will strike the bells for him to dine.
With Ozerov all were delighted,
With education, as you know,
With flattery could draw one’s gaze,
With glory Didla’s crowned there.
With jokes innocence amazed.
With morals never was severe,
With nymths she waits to make a hit.
With one of feet the floor she’s touching,
With other slowly she wheels,
Without gold can revive
Without tension he could bow:
With passion and the wit to gain,
With quick her foot the foot she beats.
With which to start? In wonder style
With yawn I’ll cover disrespect
Yet Adam Smith was well approved,
You listen to my grievous call:
